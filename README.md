## üñ• Hardware Requirements

### **Minimum Requirements:**
- **CPU:** 8-core processor (Intel i7/Ryzen 7 or higher)
- **RAM:** 16GB+ (32GB recommended for running multiple VMs)
- **Storage:** 1TB SSD (for fast virtual machine performance)
- **Network:** Dual or Quad NIC for network segmentation (optional)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Virtual Machines (VMs) Setup

This homelab uses **virtual machines** to simulate different environments and systems for cybersecurity practice. You can use **VMware**, **VirtualBox**, or **Proxmox** for managing your VMs.

### **Core VM Configurations:**
1. **Firewall/Router VM:**
   - **Software:** pfSense or OPNSense
   - **Role:** Acts as your firewall and manages traffic between different network segments.

2. **Penetration Testing VM (Attacker):**
   - **Software:** Kali Linux or Parrot OS
   - **Tools:** Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite
   - **Role:** Used to practice penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation.

3. **Target System VMs:**
   - **Software:** Windows 10, Windows Server, Ubuntu
   - **Role:** Vulnerable systems that you can attack and secure.

4. **Security Monitoring VM:**
   - **Software:** Splunk, ELK Stack, OSSEC, Suricata
   - **Role:** Collects logs and monitors network traffic for security events and potential intrusions.

## üõ† Tools and Services

Here are the essential tools you'll need for your cybersecurity homelab:

1. **Penetration Testing Tools:**
   - **Metasploit Framework:** For exploiting vulnerabilities
   - **Burp Suite:** Web application security testing
   - **Nmap:** Network scanner for discovering vulnerabilities

2. **Intrusion Detection & Prevention:**
   - **Suricata or Snort:** Open-source IDS/IPS systems to monitor network traffic.
   - **Wireshark:** Packet analysis tool for capturing and inspecting network traffic.

3. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
   - **Splunk or ELK Stack:** Collect and analyze logs from all your VMs for security events.

## üåê Network Configuration

For a secure and isolated environment, you‚Äôll need to set up separate networks for different tasks.

### **Network Segments:**
- **Internal Network:** For your main virtual machines.
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** For public-facing services like web servers.
- **VPN Network:** For secure remote access to your homelab.

## üìù Basic Setup Steps

1. **Install Virtualization Software:**
   - **Windows:** Download from [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
   - **Mac:** Download from [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

2. **Create and Set Up VMs:**
   - Install your desired OS on each VM (Kali Linux, pfSense, Windows, etc.).
   - Set up networking (use Bridged or Host-only depending on your requirements).

3. **Install Cybersecurity Tools:**
   - Install penetration testing tools (Metasploit, Nmap), IDS/IPS (Suricata), and SIEM systems (Splunk, ELK) on your VMs.

4. **Monitor and Attack:**
   - Start your lab! Perform penetration testing, monitor your network for intrusions, and practice securing your systems.
